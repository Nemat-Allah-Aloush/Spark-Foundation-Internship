### [Exploratory Data Analysis on ‘Global Terrorism’ dataset](https://github.com/Nemat-Allah-Aloush/Sparks-Foundation-Internship/blob/main/Terrorism_EDA.ipynb)
The task is about performing Exploratory Data Analysis on ‘Global Terrorism’ dataset. The dataset contains data about terrorists attacks happened from 1970 to 2017 with the exception to the year 1993. Here're some of the findings:

1. More than 50% of the terrorist attacks happend in the MENA region and south Asia. However, only after 1992 the terrorist attacks started to happen more in the MENA region and south Asia, before that they seemed to happen more in South America, Central America & Caribbean and westren Europe.
2. Since the most terrorist attacks happend in the MENA and South Asia, the count of killed and wounded people are significntaly more in those two regions.
3. 13.6% of the terrorist accidents happened in Iraq, 7.91% happened in Pakistan, 7.01% in Afghanistan and 6.58% in India. 71.48% in the other countries where in each of them no more than 4.57% occured.
4. The city that suffered the most terrorist attacks between 1970 to 2017 is Baghdad, which makes scence because Iraq is the country that suffered the most attacks at this period.
5. Taliban followed by ISIL were responsible to the most terrorist attacks. After 2004 Taliban seems to be responisible to the most attacks. And after 2013 ISIL and Taliban performed more terrorist attacks than any other group.
6. Some terrorist groups such as FMLN, SL did their attacks before 1992, after that they almost performs no attacks comparing to the other groups.
7. Private Citizens and property were the most injured due to those terrorist attacks. Bombing and Explosions were the most common Attack types. Hence,
'Expolsives' was the most used weapon among terrorist attacks.
